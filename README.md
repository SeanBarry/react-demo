## React/Blaze Demo

This tiny application was written as part of my talk at the first [https://twitter.com/ReactEdinburgh/status/837033436682543104](React Edinburgh Meetup in March 2017) .

The application has two branches - a version of the application in React.js and a version in Blaze.js

I demonstrated some of the core differences between React and Blaze, and why I prefer the React way.

The backend is for demonstration purposes only and wouldn't pass any security tests!
